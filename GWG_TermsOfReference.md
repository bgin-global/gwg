# Governance Working Group [Draft] Terms of Reference

At the inaugural meeting of the Blockchain Governance Initiative Network (BGIN) held on March 9, initial contributors agreed to establish the Governance Working Group (GWG) dealing with the governance of BGIN including organizational matters, basic logistical matters of meetings, intellectual property right (IPR) management and the group asked Aaron Wright and Shigey Suzuki to develop draft terms of reference (TOR) of GWG as Acting co-Chairs of the group. 

Following the above decision, the Acting co-Chairs have developed the following TOR in order to submit it to the wider BGIN community at the BGIN online meeting on June 18th, 2020, where they expect to gain support to start the activity of the group.
 
## The tentative goal of the group and the scope
As BGIN is still in an early stage of its development and basic organizational and operational matters are not decided yet, the GWG will take a phased approach. In the first phase, it will focus to develop a set of minimum viable documents that cover basic organizational and operational mechanisms that are necessary for activities of BGIN in the short-term. Then, it will compose a complete draft of the BGIN Charter (or By-laws) that covers all the elements identified by the BGIN community in the mid-term. GWG will design how the organization works, but it will NOT operate the organization.
 
## Tentative modality of the GWG
- GWG will assign one or two chair(s) and tentatively, Aaron Wright and Shigeya Suzuki assume the role of acting chairs for the time being.
- (Acting) chairs will appoint a few assistants to help manage the drafting process. 
- Anyone participating in BGIN can join GWG without permission and relevant information about the GWG meetings and deliberations will be circulated to BGIN members for feedback and comment.
- Those who join GWG need to follow the Core Value described in [the Genesis Document](https://github.com/bgin-global/genesis-documents/blob/master/Genesis.md). Acting Chairs can limit the participation of members who do not follow it.
- Most of the work will be done through discussion in the designated mailing list(s) with ad-hoc online meetings. (Minutes of the online meeting may be published with the Chatham House Rule.)
- Decisions will be made on a consensus basis at least until a Charter, which will define relevant rules related to decision making, is agreed.
 
## Tentative work items and process for the first phase
- Identify elements that are necessary for activities of BGIN in the short-term and give considerations on their priority (if needed)
- Develop an initial and minimum set of documents proposing mechanisms related to elements identified through designated drafting teams 
- Consult with BGIN community on these documents to finalize


## Things that are NOT dealt by GWG
- High-level concept of BGIN such as Genesis, Core Values or Work plans  -- GWG will work to develop the Charter or By-laws setting mechanisms to realize these high-level concepts
- Operation of the meetings -- GWG will develop the process to plan a meeting but is not the operator of meetings (it should be dealt by a program committee or an equivalent group for each meeting?)
- Operation and administration of BGIN including management of internal and external communication infrastructures

## Key considerations
- To discuss IPR, we need to have certain expertise such as legal matters. How should we encourage those who have such expertise?
